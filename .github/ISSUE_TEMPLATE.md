# PLEASE DO NOT FILE A BUG HERE!

Miraheze system administrators (who are responsible for github) have decided that miraheze no longer uses GitHub for incoming bugs.

Instead, they have decided to use [phabricator](https://phabricator.miraheze.org). All bugs have been migrated to the new infrastructure, and we are no longer accepting incoming bugs using github issues.

Since you can register to miraheze phabricator using your github ID using OAuth, please consider filing a bug there. phabricator's markup is almost identical to github's one, and it shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to register there and file a task there. Thank you.
